# **Technical Development Plan for Goblin's Inferno**

This document provides specific instructions for AI agents regarding the technical implementation of "Goblin's Inferno". All agents must adhere to these guidelines to ensure a cohesive and functional project. Read `DESIGN.md` to ensure adherence to the agree upon game logic.

## **Code Structure**

Game logic is split into modular ES6 files under `src/js` (e.g., `src/js/main.js`, `src/js/player.js`, `src/js/projectile.js`), and styling resides in `src/css/style.css`. Keep JavaScript modular using ES6 classes.

* **Classes & Objects:** Use JavaScript ES6 classes to represent game entities such as Player, Enemy, and Projectile.
* **Game Loop:** Manage game logic with a single continuous game loop triggered by `window.requestAnimationFrame()`.
* **State Management:** Maintain a single, central `gameState` object holding player data, enemy arrays, projectiles, the current debt, and other game-specific variables.
* **Functions:** Separate distinct functionalities into well-named functions (e.g., `updatePlayer()`, `spawnEnemies()`, `checkCollisions()`) to improve readability and maintainability.

## **File Structure**

The project consists of `index.html` at the project root and modular assets under `src/`.

* `index.html`: Root HTML with the `<canvas>` and dynamic loaders for `src/css/style.css` and `src/js/main.js`. Both URLs are cache-busted via a `?v=` query param derived from `window.APP_VERSION` or the page URL (e.g., `index.html?v=commit123`).
* `src/css/style.css`: Holds all CSS styles for the game.
* `src/js/main.js`: Entry point for the game's JavaScript; imports other modules under `src/js`.
* `src/js/player.js`, `src/js/projectile.js`, etc.: Modular game logic for entities and systems.
* **Server:** A simple npm-based HTTP server will be used to serve the `index.html` file.

## **Automated Testing Methodology**

Run the test suite with `npm test`, which executes unit tests using Jest. Tests should focus on game logic modules without requiring a browser environment.

* **State Verification:** Unit tests must inspect the `gameState` object and other module outputs to ensure mechanics work correctly. For example:
  * Check that the player's position changes after a key press.
  * Verify that an enemy's health decreases after a collision with a fireball.
  * Assert that the debt counter updates after collecting gold.
* **Performance Monitoring:** The testing suite should continue to include checks for performance metrics, such as frame rate and CPU usage, to ensure that new features do not negatively impact game performance.

## **Game Serving**

To run the game, use a simple HTTP server from the npm ecosystem. The **Code Goblin** agent should use the http-server package for this purpose.

* **Installation:** First, install the project's dependencies:
  npm install

* **Execution:** After installation, run `npm start` to serve the project root at http://localhost:8000. To bust caches for CSS/JS, append `?v=YOUR_VERSION` to the page URL (for example, `http://localhost:8000/index.html?v=dev1`).

* **Live Reload Note:** Do not manually edit `live-reload.json`. It is automatically updated by a separate Node server process running in another terminal. Just commit the updated file whenever the Node server has changed it.
